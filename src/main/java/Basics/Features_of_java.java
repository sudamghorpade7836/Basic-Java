	 Features of Java
1.Simple: Java is a simple language because its syntax is simple, clean, and easy to understand. 
Complex and ambiguous concepts of C++ are either eliminated or re-implemented in Java. For example, pointer and 
operator overloading are not used in Java.
2.Object-Oriented: In Java, everything is in the form of the object. It means it has some data and behavior.
 A program must have at least one class and object.
3.Robust: Java makes an effort to check error at run time and compile time. It uses a strong memory management system called 
garbage collector. Exception handling and garbage collection features make it strong.
4.Secure: Java is a secure programming language because it has no explicit pointer and programs runs in the virtual machine.
 Java contains a security manager that defines the access of Java classes.
5.Platform-Independent: Java provides a guarantee that code writes once and run anywhere. This byte code is platform-independent
 and can be run on any machine.
6.Portable: Java Byte code can be carried to any platform. No implementation-dependent features.
 Everything related to storage is predefined, for example, the size of primitive data types.
7.High Performance: Java is an interpreted language. Java enables high performance with the use of the Just-In-Time compiler.
8.Distributed: Java also has networking facilities. It is designed for the distributed environment
 of the internet because it supports TCP/IP protocol. It can run over the internet. EJB and RMI are used to create a distributed system.
9.Multi-threaded: Java also supports multi-threading. It means to handle more than one job a time.
