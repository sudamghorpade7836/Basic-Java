Let's understand the if-statements one by one.

1) Simple if statement:
It is the most basic statement among all control flow statements in Java. It evaluates a Boolean expression and 
enables the program to enter a block of code if the expression evaluates to true.

Syntax of if statement is given below.

if(condition) {    
statement 1; //executes when condition is true   
}    
Consider the following example in which we have used the if statement in the java code.

Student.java

Student.java

public class Student {    
public static void main(String[] args) {    
int x = 10;    
int y = 12;    
if(x+y > 20) {    
System.out.println("x + y is greater than 20");    
}    
}      
}     
Output:

x + y is greater than 20
	 * 
	 */

}
